# GAMEPLAY
# PLAYERS DONT COMPETE AGAINST ANOTHER. THEY COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER. SAME TEAM.
# RATHER THAN NUMBERS ON DICE, GAME USES LETTERS
# RATHER THAN HAVE SUITES ON CARDS, GAME USES QUESTION-TYPE AND QUESTION ON CARD
# GAME REQUIRES RECORDING DEVICE TO COLLECT ANSWERS TO QUESTION PROMPTS
# ONLINE VERSION CAN CONNECT TO LIVEPAD AND SHARE VIA EMAIL, ETC...
# A DEALER DEALS AN ARRAY OF PRESHUFFLED CARDS FROM (DECK OF 52 QUESTIONS)
# 1 PLAYER = 52 CARDS 2 PLAYERS= 26 CARDS 3 PLAYERS= 17 CARDS 4 PLAYERS= 13 CARDS 
# 5 PLAYERS+ NUMBER OF PLAYERS DIVIDE 52 CARDS WITH REMAINDER IN POT AS BONUS POINTS
# IDENTIFY CHOICE TARGETS >> SELECT DEMOGRAPHICS (MULTI - SELECT)
# RANK CHOICES SO THAT A HEIRARCHY IS FORMED
# DICE ROLL > SEE 2 LETTERS
# DICE WITH ABOVE LETTERS ON EACH FACE REPRESENTING PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS CATEGORIES
# ANSWER ROUNDS OF QUESTIONS FOR EACH DEMOGRAPHIC (52 CARD QUESTIONS)
# ROLL AND RECORD 2 LETTERS FACE UP
# BASED ON LETTERS ROLLED ANSWER QUESTIONS AS RELATED TO THAT AUDIENCE GROUP
# ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A TRIPARTITE MANNER
# THINK IN TERMS OF MARKET RESEARCH AND CLIENT KNOWLEDGE
# THINK IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING CONTENT
# THINK IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING ACCESS AND ACCESSIBILITY
# TO EACH QUESTION TELL WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT PERSON IN GENERAL
AND WHAT YOUR CULTURAL LANGUAGE WILL BE TO THAT PERSON IN GENRAL 
AND WHAT DEVICES AND SOFTWARE CONSIDERATIONS THAT PERSON REQUIRES IN GENERAL. HOWEVER, SPECIFICITY WINS THE GAME!
