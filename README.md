HUMAN ANGLE BY HUMAN ANGEL INC. est 2019 Human Angle: Considerations before the code.
# GAMEPLAY: 
First you roll the dice (PRESS PLAY). Then you answer questions (SELECT CHECKBOX).
#	GAME DESIGN: 
This game is more of a tool designed to help entrepreneurs note their biases and allow them to clarify how their business should relate to people of varying age, ethnicity, gender, income, race, and sexual orientation. 
# This project is intended to offend none, yet challenge each player to be as inclusive as possible. 
# Questions are comprised of aggregated elements that are multiplied by the number of each kind of person in the database (to be expanded). 
# Thousands of questions (some a bit weird) are randomly created by the game and presented to the player.
# Initially, a 60-second timer appears.
